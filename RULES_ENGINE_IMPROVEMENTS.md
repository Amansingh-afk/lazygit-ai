# Enhanced Rules Engine Improvements

## Overview

The rules engine has been completely rewritten and enhanced to generate much better commit messages that follow conventional commit standards and provide more specific, context-aware descriptions.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Pattern-Based Analysis**
- **Enhanced Pattern Detection**: The engine now analyzes multiple patterns simultaneously with confidence scores
- **File Type Patterns**: Sophisticated detection of documentation, tests, configuration, and style files
- **Diff Content Patterns**: Advanced analysis of git diff content for keywords and context
- **Function Patterns**: Detection of function and method changes across multiple languages
- **Version Patterns**: Automatic detection of version bumps in various formats

### 2. **Context-Aware Message Generation**
- **Branch Analysis**: Uses branch names to determine commit type and scope
- **File Path Analysis**: Extracts scope from file paths and directory structure
- **Change Context**: Analyzes the nature of changes (refactor, bug fix, feature, etc.)
- **Impact Assessment**: Determines the impact level of changes (low, medium, high)

### 3. **Enhanced Description Generation**
The engine now generates much more specific and meaningful descriptions:

#### Before (Old Engine):
```
feat: update code
fix: update files
docs: update documentation
```

#### After (Enhanced Engine):
```
docs(docs): update documentation and bump version to 0.1.1
fix(git-detection): improve git staged file detection
fix(tui-colors): improve color scheme consistency in TUI
```

### 4. **Specific Enhancements**

#### Version Bump Detection
- Automatically detects version changes in `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, etc.
- Combines version bumps with other changes intelligently
- Example: `docs(docs): update documentation and bump version to 0.1.1`

#### Color Scheme Changes
- Detects color-related changes in CSS, SCSS, and UI files
- Generates specific messages for color consistency improvements
- Example: `fix(tui-colors): improve color scheme consistency in TUI`

#### Git-Related Fixes
- Analyzes branch scope for git-related improvements
- Generates specific messages for git detection and LLM code cleanup
- Example: `fix(git-detection): improve git staged file detection`

#### Documentation Updates
- Detects documentation files and generates appropriate messages
- Combines with version bumps when both are present
- Example: `docs(docs): update documentation`

### 5. **Confidence-Based Pattern Selection**
- Each pattern has a confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- The engine selects the best pattern based on confidence and specificity
- Higher confidence patterns (like branch names) take precedence

### 6. **Enhanced Pattern Types**

#### File Type Patterns
```python
file_type_patterns = {
    "docs": {
        "patterns": ["readme", "docs", "documentation", "*.md", "*.rst", "*.txt"],
        "type": "docs",
        "confidence": 0.9
    },
    "tests": {
        "patterns": ["test", "spec", "*.test.", "*.spec.", "test_", "spec_"],
        "type": "test",
        "confidence": 0.9
    },
    # ... more patterns
}
```

#### Diff Content Patterns
```python
diff_patterns = {
    "fix": {
        "patterns": [
            r"fix\s+", r"bug\s+", r"issue\s+", r"error\s+", r"exception\s+",
            r"crash\s+", r"fail\s+", r"broken\s+", r"wrong\s+", r"incorrect\s+"
        ],
        "type": "fix",
        "confidence": 0.8
    },
    # ... more patterns
}
```

### 7. **Backward Compatibility**
- The new `EnhancedRuleEngine` is aliased as `RuleEngine` for backward compatibility
- All existing code continues to work without changes
- Configuration options remain the same

## Example Output

### Documentation Update with Version Bump
**Input**: Changes to README.md and pyproject.toml with version bump to 0.1.1
**Output**: `docs(docs): update documentation and bump version to 0.1.1`

### Git Staged File Detection Fix
**Input**: Changes to git.py with branch name "fix/git-detection"
**Output**: `fix(git-detection): improve git staged file detection`

### TUI Color Scheme Consistency Fix
**Input**: Changes to tui.py with color changes and branch name "fix/tui-colors"
**Output**: `fix(tui-colors): improve color scheme consistency in TUI`

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **CommitPattern Dataclass**
   - Represents a commit pattern with type, scope, description, and confidence
   - Used for pattern comparison and selection

2. **Pattern Analysis Methods**
   - `_analyze_all_patterns()`: Analyzes all possible patterns
   - `_select_best_pattern()`: Selects the best pattern based on confidence
   - `_apply_specific_enhancements()`: Applies context-specific enhancements

3. **Enhanced Analyzer Integration**
   - New fields in `GitAnalysis` for version changes, function changes, color changes
   - Context analysis for better understanding of change nature
   - Impact level assessment

### Configuration

The enhanced engine uses the same configuration as before, but with improved pattern matching:

```python
# Enhanced patterns are automatically initialized
self._init_patterns()

# Configuration remains the same
self.commit_config = config.get_commit_config()
self.rules_config = config.get_rules_config()
```

## Benefits

1. **More Specific Messages**: Commit messages are now much more descriptive and specific
2. **Better Context**: The engine understands the context of changes better
3. **Automatic Version Detection**: Version bumps are automatically detected and included
4. **Improved Scopes**: Better scope detection from file paths and branch names
5. **Consistent Format**: All messages follow conventional commit standards
6. **Backward Compatible**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Future Enhancements

The enhanced architecture makes it easy to add new patterns and improvements:

1. **Custom Pattern Support**: Users can add custom patterns via configuration
2. **Language-Specific Patterns**: More language-specific function and method patterns
3. **Project-Specific Rules**: Project-specific commit message rules
4. **Machine Learning Integration**: Potential for ML-based pattern learning

## Conclusion

The enhanced rules engine represents a significant improvement in commit message generation quality. It now produces messages that are:

- More specific and descriptive
- Context-aware and intelligent
- Consistent with conventional commit standards
- Automatically enhanced with relevant information

This makes the lazygit-ai tool much more useful for developers who want meaningful, professional commit messages without requiring AI assistance.
